# CleanSlate - The Code Hygiene Bot for Vibe Coders

CleanSlate is a command-line tool designed for vibe codersâ€”developers who may not fully understand code hygiene but are eager to clean up and improve their code. It scans JavaScript codebases, detects issues like unused functions, complex code, TODO/FIXME comments, and more, and then provides helpful comments to make the code more understandable, maintainable, and clean.

## Features

CleanSlate detects the following code hygiene issues:

### 1. Unused Code Detection
- **Unused Functions**: Functions that are declared but never called
- **Unused Variables**: Variables that are declared but never used
- **Unused Imports**: Import statements that aren't utilized in the code

### 2. Complex Code Identification
- **Long Functions**: Functions that exceed 50 lines of code
- **Deeply Nested Code**: Code with more than 3 levels of nesting (if/for/while statements)
- **Complex Logic**: Identifies overly complex conditional statements

### 3. Dead Code Detection
- **Unreachable Code**: Code that appears after return statements
- **Redundant Conditions**: Conditions that will never be met

### 4. TODO/FIXME Management
- **Pending Tasks**: Identifies TODO and FIXME comments in the code
- **Suggests Improvements**: Adds context to existing TODO comments

### 5. Reporting
- **Terminal Output**: Clear, color-coded terminal output of issues
- **Markdown Reports**: Generates detailed markdown reports with issue summaries
- **Inline Comments**: Adds helpful comments directly to your code

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally from npm
npm install -g clean-slate
```

### Local Installation

```bash
# Install in your project
npm install clean-slate

# Run using npx
npx clean-slate scan ./src
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### Scan a directory for code hygiene issues

```bash
clean-slate scan ./src
```

This will scan all JavaScript files in the `./src` directory and display any issues found in the terminal with color-coded output.

#### Generate a detailed report

```bash
clean-slate report
```

This will generate a comprehensive markdown report (`report.md`) summarizing all the issues found during the last scan, including:
- Total number of issues by type
- Issues organized by file
- Specific line numbers and code snippets
- Recommended actions for each issue type

#### Add inline comments to your code

```bash
clean-slate comment --inline
```

This will automatically insert helpful comments directly in your code where issues were detected:
- Comments are prefixed with `// CLEAN-SLATE: ` for easy identification
- Each comment explains the issue and suggests how to fix it
- Comments are placed directly above the problematic code

#### Dry run mode

```bash
clean-slate scan ./src --dry-run
```

This will show the detected issues without modifying any files or generating reports, perfect for initial assessment.

### Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow using CleanSlate:

1. **Initial Scan**: Run `clean-slate scan ./src` to identify issues
2. **Review Issues**: Look through the terminal output to understand what problems exist
3. **Generate Report**: Run `clean-slate report` to create a shareable document of all issues
4. **Add Comments**: Run `clean-slate comment --inline` to add helpful comments to your code
5. **Fix Issues**: Address the problems identified in your code
6. **Verify Fixes**: Run another scan to confirm issues are resolved

## Issue Types in Detail

### Unused Code
Unused code increases maintenance burden and can lead to confusion. CleanSlate identifies:
- Functions that are defined but never called
- Variables that are declared but never used
- Import statements that aren't utilized

### Long Functions
Functions longer than 50 lines are flagged as they:
- Are harder to understand and maintain
- Often try to do too many things
- Are more difficult to test properly

### Deeply Nested Code
Code with more than 3 levels of nesting is flagged because:
- It's difficult to follow the execution flow
- It increases cognitive load when reading
- It's often a sign that the code should be refactored

### Dead Code
Code that will never execute is identified:
- Statements after return statements
- Conditions that can never be true
- Unused branches in switch statements

### TODO/FIXME Comments
These comments often indicate:
- Incomplete features
- Known bugs that need fixing
- Areas that need optimization

## Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy Error

If you encounter an error like:
```
clean-slate : File C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm\clean-slate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
```

You have three options:

1. **Use Command Prompt instead of PowerShell**
   - Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
   - Run the commands there instead

2. **Change PowerShell's execution policy** (as Administrator):
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

3. **Use npx to run the tool**:
   ```
   npx clean-slate scan ./src
   ```

### Common Issues

#### No Issues Found When Expected
If CleanSlate reports no issues when you expect it to find some:
- Check that you're scanning the correct directory
- Verify that your files have the `.js` extension
- Try running with more verbose output: `clean-slate scan ./src --verbose`

#### Error Parsing JavaScript Files
If you see syntax errors:
- Ensure your code is valid JavaScript
- Check for missing semicolons or brackets
- Verify that you're not using newer JavaScript features unsupported by the parser
